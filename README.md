# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies whether a given passenger survived the disaster based on various features.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle's **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition. It contains information about the passengers, including demographic data, class, and other factors that might influence survival.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the Titanic dataset (train and test files).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and model building.
- `models/`: Saved models and related files.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `results/`: Model evaluation results and visualizations, including `submission.csv`.

🤖 Model Used
	•	Logistic Regression: This model is used for classification to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

 ---

 📊 Results

The performance of the model is evaluated based on Accuracy Score and Cross-Validation Score. Detailed results and model evaluation metrics can be found in the results/ directory.
	•	Kaggle Submission: The submission.csv file for Kaggle can be found in the results/ folder. It contains predictions for all the entries in the test set.
