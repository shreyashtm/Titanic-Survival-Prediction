Titanic Survival Prediction

Project Overview :

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies whether a given passenger survived the disaster based on various features.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster. It contains information about the passengers, including demographic data, class, and other factors that might influence survival.

Project Structure

data/ - Contains the Titanic dataset (train and test files).

notebooks/ - Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and model building.

models/ - Saved models and related files.

scripts/ - Python scripts for data processing and model training.

results/ - Model evaluation results and visualizations.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shreyashtm/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
To run the model training and prediction:

Open the Jupyter notebook from the notebooks/ directory:

jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb

Run the notebook cells to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate the performance.

Model Used:  Logistic Regression

Results:
The performance of the model is evaluated based on Accuracy Score and Cross-Validation Score. Detailed results can be found in the results/ directory.

Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request for any improvements.

I will keep working on the data and try to make possible improvements as I see fit.
