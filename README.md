# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies whether a given passenger survived the disaster based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle's **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition. It contains information about the passengers, including demographic data, class, and other factors that might influence survival.
